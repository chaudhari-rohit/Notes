- `Aggregation`: In a basic aggregation relationship, the lifecycle of a PART class is 
  independent of the WHOLE class’s lifecycle. In other words, aggregation implies a relationship where the `child can exist independently of the parent`.
- `Composition`: The composition aggregation relationship is just another form of the aggregation relationship, but the `child class’s instance lifecycle is dependent on the parent class’s instance` lifecycle. In other words, Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent  
- `Generalization`: Generalization is the mechanism for combining similar classes of objects into 
   a single, more general class. `Extends` kind of thing.
